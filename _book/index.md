# About

This is a book project at trying to condense various **RLadies** meetings, videos, lectures and talks into a single book. This goal is super ambitious and one that will not be complete. 
<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

## Usage 

Each book chapter are topics covered by RLadies chapters, and their code that is from their github repository. The idea is to have each chapter dedicated to a topic despite which RLadies chapter presented it.

<!-- Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. -->

<!-- Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`. -->

<!-- The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. -->

## RLadies book

This book is an idea to have as much of RLadies knowledge that exists in Github repos, meetups and YouTube videos to be in one readable format. Due to the global reach of R chapters there will be redundancy. This book will focus on English presentations (for now) until someone else comes along to add to this project. 

It is the hope this volume of knowledge is read and shared, along with additions to keep up with the copious RLadies meetups. 



<!-- ## Preview book -->

<!-- As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- bookdown::serve_book() -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```{r include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # automatically create a bib database for R packages -->
<!-- knitr::write_bib(c( -->
<!--   .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown' -->
<!-- ), 'packages.bib') -->
<!-- ``` -->
