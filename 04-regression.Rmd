## Linear Regression Models

Linear Regression or Linear Model (LM) using happiness data from the World Health Organization, this section is brought to you by **RLadies Freiburg** Divya and Elisa. The happiness data can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_freiburg/master/2019-10-Modelling%201%20-%20LM%2C%20LMM%20and%20plots/Happiness_2016.csv). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# load in the data (the dataset is read in as raw)
happiness_2016 = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_freiburg/master/2019-10-Modelling%201%20-%20LM%2C%20LMM%20and%20plots/Happiness_2016.csv')

knitr::kable(head(happiness_2016) ) 
```



The question is, *what parameters are there? What questions can we address using these factors.?* *Does trust in government a variable?*
